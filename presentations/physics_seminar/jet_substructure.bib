  abstract = {We give a factorization formula for the e+e- thrust distribution dsigma/dtau with tau=1-T based on soft-collinear effective theory. The result is applicable for all tau, i.e. in the peak, tail, and far-tail regions. The formula includes O(alphas\^3) fixed-order QCD results, resummation of singular partonic alphas\^j ln\^k(tau)/tau terms with N\^3LL accuracy, hadronization effects from fitting a universal nonperturbative soft function defined in field theory, bottom quark mass effects, QED corrections, and the dominant top mass dependent terms from the axial anomaly. We do not rely on Monte Carlo generators to determine nonperturbative effects since they are not compatible with higher order perturbative analyses. Instead our treatment is based on fitting nonperturbative matrix elements in field theory, which are moments Omega\_i of a nonperturbative soft function. We present a global analysis of all available thrust data measured at center-of-mass energies Q=35 to 207 GeV in the tail region, where a two parameter fit to \$\textbackslash alpha\_s(m\_Z)\$ and the first moment Omega\_1 suffices. We use a short distance scheme to define Omega\_1, called the R-gap scheme, thus ensuring that the perturbative dsigma/dtau does not suffer from an O(Lambda\_QCD) renormalon ambiguity. We find alphas(mZ)=0.1135 \textbackslash pm (0.0002)\_\{expt\} \textbackslash pm (0.0005)\_\{hadr\} \textbackslash pm (0.0009)\_\{pert\}, with chi\^2/dof=0.91, where the displayed 1-sigma errors are the total experimental error, the hadronization uncertainty, and the perturbative theory uncertainty, respectively. The hadronization uncertainty in alphas is significantly decreased compared to earlier analyses by our two parameter fit, which determines Omega\_1=0.323 GeV with 16\% uncertainty.},

At sufficiently high energies, this radiation pattern is enhanced collinear to the initiating particle, resulting in a complex, many-body quantum system. Classical Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation approaches work well to capture many of the salient features of the shower of radiation, but cannot capture all quantum effects. We show how quantum algorithms are well-suited for describing the quantum properties of final state radiation. In particular, we develop a polynomial time quantum final state shower that accurately models the effects of intermediate spin states similar to those present in high energy electroweak showers. The algorithm is explicitly demonstrated for a simplified quantum field theory on a quantum computer.},

As in the case of previously known prescriptions for various limits of momenta and masses, the terms of the threshold expansion are associated with subgraphs of a given graph and are explicitly written through Taylor expansions of the corresponding integrands in certain sets of parameters. They are manifestly homogeneous in the threshold expansion parameter, so that the calculation of the given Feynman integral near the threshold reduces to the calculation of integrals of a much simpler type. The general method is illustrated by two-loop two-point and three-point diagrams. We discuss the use of the threshold expansion for problems of physical interest, such as the next-to-next-to-leading order heavy-quark production cross sections close to threshold and matching calculations and power counting in non-relativistic effective theories.},

  abstract = {The heavy jet mass distribution in e+e- collisions is computed to next-to-nextto-next-to leading logarithmic (N3LL) and next-to-next-to leading fixed order accuracy (NNLO). The singular terms predicted from the resummed distribution are confirmed by the fixed order distributions allowing a precise extraction of the unknown soft function coefficients. A number of quantitative and qualitative comparisons of heavy jet mass and the related thrust distribution are made. From fitting to ALEPH data, a value of {$\alpha$}sis extracted, {$\alpha$}s(mZ) = 0.1220 {$\pm$} 0.0031, which is larger than, but not in conflict with, the corresponding value for thrust. A weighted average of the two produces {$\alpha$}s(mZ) = 0.1193 {$\pm$} 0.0027, consistent with the world average. A study of the non-perturbative corrections shows that the flat direction observed for thrust between {$\alpha$}sand a simple non-perturbative shape parameter is not lifted in combining with heavy jet mass. The Monte Carlo treatment of hadronization gives qualitatively different results for thrust and heavy jet mass, and we conclude that it cannot be trusted to add power corrections to the event shape distributions at this accuracy. Whether a more sophisticated effective field theory approach to power corrections can reconcile the thrust and heavy jet mass distributions remains an open question.},

As well as considering trimming, pruning and the mass-drop tagger, we introduce modified tools with improved analytical and phenomenological behaviours. Most taggers have double logarithmic resummed structures. The modified mass-drop tagger is special in that it involves only single logarithms, and is free from a complex class of terms known as non-global logarithms. The modification of pruning brings an improved ability to discriminate between the different colour structures that characterise signal and background.

  abstract = {Differential spectra in observables that resolve additional soft or collinear QCD emissions exhibit Sudakov double logarithms in the form of logarithmic plus distributions. Important examples are the total transverse momentum qT in color-singlet production, N -jettiness (with thrust or beam thrust as special cases), but also jet mass and more complicated jet substructure observables. The all-order logarithmic structure of such distributions is often fully encoded in differential equations, so-called (renormalization group) evolution equations. We introduce a well-defined technique of distributional scale setting, which allows one to treat logarithmic plus distributions like ordinary logarithms when solving these differential equations. In particular, this allows one (through canonical scale choices) to minimize logarithmic contributions in the boundary terms of the solution, and to obtain the full distributional logarithmic structure from the solution's evolution kernel directly in distribution space. We apply this technique to the qT distribution, where the two-dimensional nature of convolutions leads to additional difficulties (compared to one-dimensional cases like thrust), and for which the resummation in distribution (or momentum) space has been a long-standing open question. For the first time, we show how to perform the RG evolution fully in momentum space, thereby directly resumming the logarithms [lnn(qT2 /Q2)/qT2 ]+ appearing in the physical qT distribution. The resummation accuracy is then solely determined by the perturbative expansion of the associated anomalous dimensions.},

In this work we make predictions for quark and gluon jet shape distributions in N-jet final states in e+e- collisions, defined with a cone or recombination algorithm, where we measure some jet shape observable on a subset of these jets. Using the framework of Soft-Collinear Effective Theory, we prove a factorization theorem for jet shape distributions and demonstrate the consistent renormalization-group running of the functions in the factorization theorem for any number of measured and unmeasured jets, any number of quark and gluon jets, and any angular size R of the jets, as long as R is much smaller than the angular separation between jets. We calculate the jet and soft functions for angularity jet shapes {$\tau\alpha$}to one-loop order \$ \textbackslash left( \{\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}\textbackslash left( \{\{\textbackslash alpha\_s\}\} \textbackslash right)\} \textbackslash right) \$and resum a subset of the large logarithms of {$\tau\alpha$}needed for next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) accuracy for both cone and kT-type jets.

The depth of the circuit grows linearly with p times (at worst) the number of constraints. If p is fixed, that is, independent of the input size, the algorithm makes use of efficient classical preprocessing. If p grows with the input size a different strategy is proposed. We study the algorithm as applied to MaxCut on regular graphs and analyze its performance on 2-regular and 3-regular graphs for fixed p. For p = 1, on 3-regular graphs the quantum algorithm always finds a cut that is at least 0.6924 times the size of the optimal cut.},

Factorization is formulated as the equality at leading power of scattering amplitudes in QCD with other amplitudes in QCD computed from a product of operator matrix elements. The equivalence is regulator independent and gauge independent. As the formulation relates amplitudes to the same amplitudes with additional soft or collinear particles, it includes as special cases the factorization of soft currents and collinear splitting functions from generic matrix elements, both of which are shown to be process independent to all orders. We show that the overlapping soft-collinear region is naturally accounted for by vacuum matrix elements of kinked Wilson lines. Although the proof is self-contained, it combines techniques developed for the study of pinch surfaces, scattering amplitudes, and effective field theory.},

When performing phase-space integrals over such states, one would generally like to avoid putting in explicit cuts to separate soft from collinear momenta. Removing these cuts induces an overcounting of the soft-collinear region and adds new infrared-ultraviolet divergences in the collinear region. In this paper, we first present a regulator-independent subtraction algorithm for removing soft-collinear overlap at the amplitude level which may be useful in pertubative QCD. We then discuss how both the soft-collinear and infrared-ultraviolet overlaps can be undone for certain observables in a way which respects factorization. Our discussion clarifies some of the subtleties in phase-space subtractions and includes a proof of the infrared finiteness of a suitably subtracted jet function. These results complete the connection between factorized QCD and the soft-collinear effective theory.},

Using a sequence of effective field theories we connect the production energy, mass, and top width scales, Q{$\gg$}m{$\gg\Gamma$}, for the top jet cross section, and derive a QCD factorization theorem for the top invariant mass spectrum. Our analysis accounts for {$\alpha$}s corrections from the production and mass scales, corrections due to constraints in defining invariant masses, nonperturbative corrections from the cross talk between the jets, and {$\alpha$}s corrections to the Breit-Wigner line shape. This paper mainly focuses on deriving the factorization theorem for hemisphere invariant mass distributions and other event shapes in e+e- collisions applicable at a future linear collider. We show that the invariant mass distribution is not a simple Breit-Wigner function involving the top width. Even at leading order it is shifted and broadened by nonperturbative soft QCD effects. We predict that the invariant mass peak position increases linearly with Q/m due to these nonperturbative effects. They are encoded in terms of a universal soft function that also describes soft effects for massless dijet events. In a future paper we compute {$\alpha$}s corrections to the jet invariant mass spectrum, including a summation of large logarithms between the scales Q, m, and {$\Gamma$}.},

  abstract = {Jet grooming algorithms are widely used in experimental analyses at hadron colliders to remove contaminating radiation from within jets. While the algorithms perform a great service to the experiments, their intricate algorithmic structure and multiple parameters has frustrated precision theoretic understanding. In this paper, we demonstrate that one particular groomer called soft drop actually makes precision jet substructure easier. In particular, we derive a factorization formula for a large class of soft drop jet substructure observables, including jet mass. The essential observation that allows for this factorization is that, without the soft wide-angle radiation groomed by soft drop, all singular contributions are collinear. The simplicity and universality of the collinear limit in QCD allows us to show that to all orders, the normalized differential cross section has no contributions from non-global logarithms. It is also independent of process, up to the relative fraction of quark and gluon jets. In fact, soft drop allows us to define this fraction precisely. The factorization theorem also explains why soft drop observables are less sensitive to hadronization than their ungroomed counterparts. Using the factorization theorem, we resum the soft drop jet mass to next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. This requires calculating some clustering effects that are closely related to corresponding effects found in jet veto calculations. We match our resummed calculation to fixed order results for both e+e- \textrightarrow{} dijets and pp \textrightarrow{} Z + j events, producing the first jet substructure predictions (groomed or ungroomed) to this accuracy for the LHC.},

Second, using the leading-order result and numerical results through next-to-next-to-leading order, we show that cusps in the distribution on the interior of phase space at leading-order are softened at higher orders. Finally, using analytic and numerical results, we show that terms that violate the assumptions of the factorization theorem for groomed jet mass are numerically much smaller than expected from power counting.

  abstract = {An outstanding problem in QCD and jet physics is the factorization and resummation of logarithms that arise due to phase space constraints, so-called non-global logarithms (NGLs). In this paper, we show that NGLs can be factorized and resummed down to an unresolved infrared scale by making sufficiently many measurements on a jet or other restricted phase space region. Resummation is accomplished by renormalization group evolution of the objects in the factorization theorem and anomalous dimensions can be calculated to any perturbative accuracy and with any number of colors. To connect with the NGLs of more inclusive measurements, we present a novel perturbative expansion which is controlled by the volume of the allowed phase space for unresolved emissions. Arbitrary accuracy can be obtained by making more and more measurements so to resolve lower and lower scales. We find that even a minimal number of measurements produces agreement with Monte Carlo methods for leading-logarithmic resummation of NGLs at the sub-percent level over the full dynamical range relevant for the Large Hadron Collider. We also discuss other applications of our factorization theorem to soft jet dynamics and how to extend to higher-order accuracy.},

  abstract = {We introduce a new jet substructure technique called "soft drop declustering", which recursively removes soft wide-angle radiation from a jet. The soft drop algorithm depends on two parameters--a soft threshold \$z\_\textbackslash text\{cut\}\$ and an angular exponent \$\textbackslash beta\$--with the \$\textbackslash beta = 0\$ limit corresponding roughly to the (modified) mass drop procedure. To gain an analytic understanding of soft drop and highlight the \$\textbackslash beta\$ dependence, we perform resummed calculations for three observables on soft-dropped jets: the energy correlation functions, the groomed jet radius, and the energy loss due to soft drop. The \$\textbackslash beta = 0\$ limit of the energy loss is particularly interesting, since it is not only "Sudakov safe" but also largely insensitive to the value of the strong coupling constant. While our calculations are strictly accurate only to modified leading-logarithmic order, we also include a discussion of higher-order effects such as multiple emissions and (the absence of) non-global logarithms. We compare our analytic results to parton shower simulations and find good agreement, and we also estimate the impact of non-perturbative effects such as hadronization and the underlying event. Finally, we demonstrate how soft drop can be used for tagging boosted W bosons, and we speculate on the potential advantages of using soft drop for pileup mitigation.},

We introduce a new framework to treat the shape function, which consistently incorporates its renormalization group evolution and all constraints on its shape and moments in any short distance mass scheme. At the same time it allows a reliable treatment of the uncertainties. We develop an expansion in a suitable complete set of orthonormal basis functions, which provides a procedure for systematically controlling the uncertainties due to the unknown functional form of the shape function. This is a significant improvement over fits to model functions. Given any model for the shape function, our construction gives an orthonormal basis in which the model occurs as the first term, and corrections to it can be studied. We introduce a new short distance scheme, the "invisible scheme", for the kinetic energy matrix element, lambda\_1. We obtain closed form results for the differential rates that incorporate perturbative corrections and a summations of logarithms at any order in perturbation theory, and present results using known next-to-next-to-leading order expressions. The experimental implementation of our framework is straightforward.},

  abstract = {LHC measurements involve cuts on several observables, but resummed calculations are mostly restricted to single variables. We show how the resummation of a class of double-differential measurements can be achieved through an extension of Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET). A prototypical application is pp \textrightarrow{} Z + 0 jets, where the jet veto is imposed through the beam thrust event shape T\$\$ \textbackslash mathcal\{T\} \$\$, and the transverse momentum pTof the Z boson is measured. A standard SCET analysis suffices for pT{$\sim$}mZ1/2T1/2\$\$ \{p\}\_T\textbackslash sim \{m\}\_Z\^\{1/2\}\{\textbackslash mathcal\{T\}\}\^\{1/2\} \$\$and pT{$\sim$} T\$\$ \textbackslash mathcal\{T\} \$\$, but additional collinear-soft modes are needed in the intermediate regime. We show how to match the factorization theorems that describe these three different regions of phase space, and discuss the corresponding relations between fully-unintegrated parton distribution functions, soft functions and the newly defined collinear-soft functions. The missing ingredients needed at NNLL/NLO accuracy are calculated, providing a check of our formalism. We also revisit the calculation of the measurement of two angularities on a single jet in JHEP 1409 (2014) 046, finding a correction to their conjecture for the NLL cross section at O{$\alpha$}s2\$\$ \textbackslash mathcal\{O\}\textbackslash left(\{\textbackslash alpha\}\_s\^2\textbackslash right) \$\$.},

  abstract = {This report on progress explores recent advances in our theoretical and experimental understanding of the physics of open quantum systems (OQSs). The study of such systems represents a core problem in modern physics that has evolved to assume an unprecedented interdisciplinary character. OQSs consist of some localized, microscopic, region that is coupled to an external environment by means of an appropriate interaction. Examples of such systems may be found in numerous areas of physics, including atomic and nuclear physics, photonics, biophysics, and mesoscopic physics. It is the latter area that provides the main focus of this review, an emphasis that is driven by the capacity that exists to subject mesoscopic devices to unprecedented control. We thus provide a detailed discussion of the behavior of mesoscopic devices (and other OQSs) in terms of the projection-operator formalism, according to which the system under study is considered to be comprised of a localized region (Q), embedded into a well-defined environment (P) of scattering wavefunctions (with Q + P = 1). The Q subspace must be treated using the concepts of non-Hermitian physics, and of particular interest here is: the capacity of the environment to mediate a coupling between the different states of Q; the role played by the presence of exceptional points (EPs) in the spectra of OQSs; the influence of EPs on the rigidity of the wavefunction phases, and; the ability of EPs to initiate a dynamical phase transition (DPT). EPs are singular points in the continuum, at which two resonance states coalesce, that is where they exhibit a non-avoided crossing. DPTs occur when the quantum dynamics of the open system causes transitions between non-analytically connected states, as a function of some external control parameter. Much like conventional phase transitions, the behavior of the system on one side of the DPT does not serve as a reliable indicator of that on the other. In addition to discussing experiments on mesoscopic quantum point contacts that provide evidence of the environmentally-mediated coupling of quantum states, we also review manifestations of DPTs in mesoscopic devices and other systems. These experiments include observations of resonance-trapping behavior in microwave cavities and open quantum dots, phase lapses in tunneling through single-electron transistors, and spin swapping in atomic ensembles. Other possible manifestations of this phenomenon are presented, including various superradiant phenomena in low-dimensional semiconductors. From these discussions a generic picture of OQSs emerges in which the environmentally-mediated coupling between different quantum states plays a critical role in governing the system behavior. The ability to control or manipulate this interaction may even lead to new applications in photonics and electronics.},

  abstract = {The resummed differential thrust rate in e+e- annihilation is calculated using soft-collinear effective theory (SCET). The resulting distribution in the two-jet region (T{$\sim$}1) is found to agree with the corresponding expression derived by the standard approach. A matching procedure to account for finite corrections at T{$<$}1 is then described. There are two important advantages of the SCET approach. First, SCET manifests a dynamical seesaw scale q=p2/Q in addition to the center-of-mass energy Q and the jet mass scale p{$\sim$}Q{$\surd$}(1-T). Thus, the resummation of logs of p/q can be cleanly distinguished from the resummation of logs of Q/p. Second, finite parts of loop amplitudes appear in specific places in the perturbative distribution: in the matching to the hard function, at the scale Q, in matching to the jet function, at the scale p, and in matching to the soft function, at the scale q. This allows for a consistent merger of fixed order corrections and resummation. In particular, the total NLO e+e- cross section is reproduced from these finite parts without having to perform additional infrared regulation.},

While the evolution of a quantum state under a Hamiltonian is straightforward (if sometimes expensive), using quantum computers to determine the ground state phase diagram of a quantum model and the properties of its phases is more involved. Using the Hubbard model as a prototypical example, we here show all the steps necessary to determine its phase diagram and ground state properties on a quantum computer. In particular, we discuss strategies for efficiently determining and preparing the ground state of the Hubbard model starting from various mean-field states with broken symmetry. We present an efficient procedure to prepare arbitrary Slater determinants as initial states and present the complete set of quantum circuits needed to evolve from these to the ground state of the Hubbard model. We show that, using efficient nesting of the various terms each time step in the evolution can be performed with just \$\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}(N)\$ gates and \$\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}(\textbackslash log N)\$ circuit depth. We give explicit circuits to measure arbitrary local observables and static and dynamic correlation functions, both in the time and frequency domain. We further present efficient non-destructive approaches to measurement that avoid the need to re-prepare the ground state after each measurement and that quadratically reduce the measurement error.},
