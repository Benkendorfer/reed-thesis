% This is the Reed College LaTeX thesis template. Most of the work 
% for the document class was done by Sam Noble (SN), as well as this
% template. Later comments etc. by Ben Salzberg (BTS). Additional
% restructuring and APA support by Jess Youngberg (JY).
% Your comments and suggestions are more than welcome; please email
% them to cus@reed.edu
%
% See http://web.reed.edu/cis/help/latex.html for help. There are a 
% great bunch of help pages there, with notes on
% getting started, bibtex, etc. Go there and read it if you're not
% already familiar with LaTeX.
%
% Any line that starts with a percent symbol is a comment. 
% They won't show up in the document, and are useful for notes 
% to yourself and explaining commands. 
% Commenting also removes a line from the document; 
% very handy for troubleshooting problems. -BTS

% As far as I know, this follows the requirements laid out in 
% the 2002-2003 Senior Handbook. Ask a librarian to check the 
% document before binding. -SN
