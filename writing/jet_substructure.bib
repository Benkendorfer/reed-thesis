  abstract = {We give a factorization formula for the e+e- thrust distribution dsigma/dtau with tau=1-T based on soft-collinear effective theory. The result is applicable for all tau, i.e. in the peak, tail, and far-tail regions. The formula includes O(alphas\^3) fixed-order QCD results, resummation of singular partonic alphas\^j ln\^k(tau)/tau terms with N\^3LL accuracy, hadronization effects from fitting a universal nonperturbative soft function defined in field theory, bottom quark mass effects, QED corrections, and the dominant top mass dependent terms from the axial anomaly. We do not rely on Monte Carlo generators to determine nonperturbative effects since they are not compatible with higher order perturbative analyses. Instead our treatment is based on fitting nonperturbative matrix elements in field theory, which are moments Omega\_i of a nonperturbative soft function. We present a global analysis of all available thrust data measured at center-of-mass energies Q=35 to 207 GeV in the tail region, where a two parameter fit to \$\textbackslash alpha\_s(m\_Z)\$ and the first moment Omega\_1 suffices. We use a short distance scheme to define Omega\_1, called the R-gap scheme, thus ensuring that the perturbative dsigma/dtau does not suffer from an O(Lambda\_QCD) renormalon ambiguity. We find alphas(mZ)=0.1135 \textbackslash pm (0.0002)\_\{expt\} \textbackslash pm (0.0005)\_\{hadr\} \textbackslash pm (0.0009)\_\{pert\}, with chi\^2/dof=0.91, where the displayed 1-sigma errors are the total experimental error, the hadronization uncertainty, and the perturbative theory uncertainty, respectively. The hadronization uncertainty in alphas is significantly decreased compared to earlier analyses by our two parameter fit, which determines Omega\_1=0.323 GeV with 16\% uncertainty.},

  abstract = {Jet substructure quantities are measured using jets groomed with the soft-drop grooming procedure in dijet events from 32.9 fb−1 of pp collisions collected with the ATLAS detector at √s=13 TeV. These observables are sensitive to a wide range of QCD phenomena. Some observables, such as the jet mass and opening angle between the two subjets which pass the soft-drop condition, can be described by a high-order (resummed) series in the strong coupling constant αS. Other observables, such as the momentum sharing between the two subjets, are nearly independent of αS. These observables can be constructed using all interacting particles or using only charged particles reconstructed in the inner tracking detectors. Track-based versions of these observables are not collinear safe, but are measured more precisely, and universal nonperturbative functions can absorb the collinear singularities. The unfolded data are directly compared with QCD calculations and hadron-level Monte Carlo simulations. The measurements are performed in different pseudorapidity regions, which are then used to extract quark and gluon jet shapes using the predicted quark and gluon fractions in each region. All of the parton shower and analytical calculations provide an excellent description of the data in most regions of phase space.},

As in the case of previously known prescriptions for various limits of momenta and masses, the terms of the threshold expansion are associated with subgraphs of a given graph and are explicitly written through Taylor expansions of the corresponding integrands in certain sets of parameters. They are manifestly homogeneous in the threshold expansion parameter, so that the calculation of the given Feynman integral near the threshold reduces to the calculation of integrals of a much simpler type. The general method is illustrated by two-loop two-point and three-point diagrams. We discuss the use of the threshold expansion for problems of physical interest, such as the next-to-next-to-leading order heavy-quark production cross sections close to threshold and matching calculations and power counting in non-relativistic effective theories.},

  abstract = {The heavy jet mass distribution in e+e- collisions is computed to next-to-nextto-next-to leading logarithmic (N3LL) and next-to-next-to leading fixed order accuracy (NNLO). The singular terms predicted from the resummed distribution are confirmed by the fixed order distributions allowing a precise extraction of the unknown soft function coefficients. A number of quantitative and qualitative comparisons of heavy jet mass and the related thrust distribution are made. From fitting to ALEPH data, a value of {$\alpha$}sis extracted, {$\alpha$}s(mZ) = 0.1220 {$\pm$} 0.0031, which is larger than, but not in conflict with, the corresponding value for thrust. A weighted average of the two produces {$\alpha$}s(mZ) = 0.1193 {$\pm$} 0.0027, consistent with the world average. A study of the non-perturbative corrections shows that the flat direction observed for thrust between {$\alpha$}sand a simple non-perturbative shape parameter is not lifted in combining with heavy jet mass. The Monte Carlo treatment of hadronization gives qualitatively different results for thrust and heavy jet mass, and we conclude that it cannot be trusted to add power corrections to the event shape distributions at this accuracy. Whether a more sophisticated effective field theory approach to power corrections can reconcile the thrust and heavy jet mass distributions remains an open question.},

Important examples are the total transverse momentum qT in color-singlet production, N -jettiness (with thrust or beam thrust as special cases), but also jet mass and more complicated jet substructure observables. The all-order logarithmic structure of such distributions is often fully encoded in differential equations, so-called (renormalization group) evolution equations. We introduce a well-defined technique of distributional scale setting, which allows one to treat logarithmic plus distributions like ordinary logarithms when solving these differential equations. In particular, this allows one (through canonical scale choices) to minimize logarithmic contributions in the boundary terms of the solution, and to obtain the full distributional logarithmic structure from the solution's evolution kernel directly in distribution space. We apply this technique to the qT distribution, where the two-dimensional nature of convolutions leads to additional difficulties (compared to one-dimensional cases like thrust), and for which the resummation in distribution (or momentum) space has been a long-standing open question. For the first time, we show how to perform the RG evolution fully in momentum space, thereby directly resumming the logarithms [lnn(qT2 /Q2)/qT2 ]+ appearing in the physical qT distribution. The resummation accuracy is then solely determined by the perturbative expansion of the associated anomalous dimensions.},

Using the framework of Soft-Collinear Effective Theory, we prove a factorization theorem for jet shape distributions and demonstrate the consistent renormalization-group running of the functions in the factorization theorem for any number of measured and unmeasured jets, any number of quark and gluon jets, and any angular size R of the jets, as long as R is much smaller than the angular separation between jets. We calculate the jet and soft functions for angularity jet shapes {$\tau\alpha$}to one-loop order \$ \textbackslash left( \{\textbackslash mathcal\{O\}\textbackslash left( \{\{\textbackslash alpha\_s\}\} \textbackslash right)\} \textbackslash right) \$and resum a subset of the large logarithms of {$\tau\alpha$}needed for next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) accuracy for both cone and kT-type jets.

Factorization is formulated as the equality at leading power of scattering amplitudes in QCD with other amplitudes in QCD computed from a product of operator matrix elements. The equivalence is regulator independent and gauge independent. As the formulation relates amplitudes to the same amplitudes with additional soft or collinear particles, it includes as special cases the factorization of soft currents and collinear splitting functions from generic matrix elements, both of which are shown to be process independent to all orders. We show that the overlapping soft-collinear region is naturally accounted for by vacuum matrix elements of kinked Wilson lines. Although the proof is self-contained, it combines techniques developed for the study of pinch surfaces, scattering amplitudes, and effective field theory.},

  abstract = {Factorization in gauge theories holds at the amplitude or amplitude-squared level for states of given soft or collinear momenta. When performing phase-space integrals over such states, one would generally like to avoid putting in explicit cuts to separate soft from collinear momenta. Removing these cuts induces an overcounting of the soft-collinear region and adds new infrared-ultraviolet divergences in the collinear region. In this paper, we first present a regulator-independent subtraction algorithm for removing soft-collinear overlap at the amplitude level which may be useful in pertubative QCD. We then discuss how both the soft-collinear and infrared-ultraviolet overlaps can be undone for certain observables in a way which respects factorization.

  abstract = {We construct jet observables for energetic top quarks that can be used to determine a short-distance top quark mass from reconstruction in e+e- collisions with accuracy better than {$\Lambda$}QCD. Using a sequence of effective field theories we connect the production energy, mass, and top width scales, Q{$\gg$}m{$\gg\Gamma$}, for the top jet cross section, and derive a QCD factorization theorem for the top invariant mass spectrum. Our analysis accounts for {$\alpha$}s corrections from the production and mass scales, corrections due to constraints in defining invariant masses, nonperturbative corrections from the cross talk between the jets, and {$\alpha$}s corrections to the Breit-Wigner line shape. This paper mainly focuses on deriving the factorization theorem for hemisphere invariant mass distributions and other event shapes in e+e- collisions applicable at a future linear collider. We show that the invariant mass distribution is not a simple Breit-Wigner function involving the top width. Even at leading order it is shifted and broadened by nonperturbative soft QCD effects. We predict that the invariant mass peak position increases linearly with Q/m due to these nonperturbative effects. They are encoded in terms of a universal soft function that also describes soft effects for massless dijet events. In a future paper we compute {$\alpha$}s corrections to the jet invariant mass spectrum, including a summation of large logarithms between the scales Q, m, and {$\Gamma$}.},

  abstract = {Jet grooming algorithms are widely used in experimental analyses at hadron colliders to remove contaminating radiation from within jets. While the algorithms perform a great service to the experiments, their intricate algorithmic structure and multiple parameters has frustrated precision theoretic understanding. In this paper, we demonstrate that one particular groomer called soft drop actually makes precision jet substructure easier. In particular, we derive a factorization formula for a large class of soft drop jet substructure observables, including jet mass. The essential observation that allows for this factorization is that, without the soft wide-angle radiation groomed by soft drop, all singular contributions are collinear. The simplicity and universality of the collinear limit in QCD allows us to show that to all orders, the normalized differential cross section has no contributions from non-global logarithms. It is also independent of process, up to the relative fraction of quark and gluon jets. In fact, soft drop allows us to define this fraction precisely. The factorization theorem also explains why soft drop observables are less sensitive to hadronization than their ungroomed counterparts. Using the factorization theorem, we resum the soft drop jet mass to next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. This requires calculating some clustering effects that are closely related to corresponding effects found in jet veto calculations. We match our resummed calculation to fixed order results for both e+e- \textrightarrow{} dijets and pp \textrightarrow{} Z + j events, producing the first jet substructure predictions (groomed or ungroomed) to this accuracy for the LHC.},

In this paper, we present three results on jet grooming in perturbation theory, focusing on heavy jet mass in \$e\^+e\^-\textbackslash to\$ hadrons collisions, groomed with the modified mass drop tagger. First, we calculate the analytic cross section at leading-order. Second, using the leading-order result and numerical results through next-to-next-to-leading order, we show that cusps in the distribution on the interior of phase space at leading-order are softened at higher orders. Finally, using analytic and numerical results, we show that terms that violate the assumptions of the factorization theorem for groomed jet mass are numerically much smaller than expected from power counting. These results provide important information regarding the convergence of perturbation theory for groomed jet observables and reliable estimates for residual uncertainties in a precision calculation.},

We introduce a new framework to treat the shape function, which consistently incorporates its renormalization group evolution and all constraints on its shape and moments in any short distance mass scheme. At the same time it allows a reliable treatment of the uncertainties. We develop an expansion in a suitable complete set of orthonormal basis functions, which provides a procedure for systematically controlling the uncertainties due to the unknown functional form of the shape function. This is a significant improvement over fits to model functions. Given any model for the shape function, our construction gives an orthonormal basis in which the model occurs as the first term, and corrections to it can be studied. We introduce a new short distance scheme, the "invisible scheme", for the kinetic energy matrix element, lambda\_1. We obtain closed form results for the differential rates that incorporate perturbative corrections and a summations of logarithms at any order in perturbation theory, and present results using known next-to-next-to-leading order expressions. The experimental implementation of our framework is straightforward.},

  abstract = {LHC measurements involve cuts on several observables, but resummed calculations are mostly restricted to single variables. We show how the resummation of a class of double-differential measurements can be achieved through an extension of Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET). A prototypical application is pp \textrightarrow{} Z + 0 jets, where the jet veto is imposed through the beam thrust event shape T\$\$ \textbackslash mathcal\{T\} \$\$, and the transverse momentum pTof the Z boson is measured. A standard SCET analysis suffices for pT{$\sim$}mZ1/2T1/2\$\$ \{p\}\_T\textbackslash sim \{m\}\_Z\^\{1/2\}\{\textbackslash mathcal\{T\}\}\^\{1/2\} \$\$and pT{$\sim$} T\$\$ \textbackslash mathcal\{T\} \$\$, but additional collinear-soft modes are needed in the intermediate regime. We show how to match the factorization theorems that describe these three different regions of phase space, and discuss the corresponding relations between fully-unintegrated parton distribution functions, soft functions and the newly defined collinear-soft functions. The missing ingredients needed at NNLL/NLO accuracy are calculated, providing a check of our formalism. We also revisit the calculation of the measurement of two angularities on a single jet in JHEP 1409 (2014) 046, finding a correction to their conjecture for the NLL cross section at O{$\alpha$}s2\$\$ \textbackslash mathcal\{O\}\textbackslash left(\{\textbackslash alpha\}\_s\^2\textbackslash right) \$\$.},

The resulting distribution in the two-jet region (T{$\sim$}1) is found to agree with the corresponding expression derived by the standard approach. A matching procedure to account for finite corrections at T{$<$}1 is then described. There are two important advantages of the SCET approach. First, SCET manifests a dynamical seesaw scale q=p2/Q in addition to the center-of-mass energy Q and the jet mass scale p{$\sim$}Q{$\surd$}(1-T). Thus, the resummation of logs of p/q can be cleanly distinguished from the resummation of logs of Q/p. Second, finite parts of loop amplitudes appear in specific places in the perturbative distribution: in the matching to the hard function, at the scale Q, in matching to the jet function, at the scale p, and in matching to the soft function, at the scale q. This allows for a consistent merger of fixed order corrections and resummation. In particular, the total NLO e+e- cross section is reproduced from these finite parts without having to perform additional infrared regulation.},
