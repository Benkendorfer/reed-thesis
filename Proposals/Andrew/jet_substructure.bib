  abstract = {Jet substructure quantities are measured using jets groomed with the soft-drop grooming procedure in dijet events from 32.9 fb−1 of pp collisions collected with the ATLAS detector at √s=13 TeV. These observables are sensitive to a wide range of QCD phenomena. Some observables, such as the jet mass and opening angle between the two subjets which pass the soft-drop condition, can be described by a high-order (resummed) series in the strong coupling constant αS. Other observables, such as the momentum sharing between the two subjets, are nearly independent of αS. These observables can be constructed using all interacting particles or using only charged particles reconstructed in the inner tracking detectors. Track-based versions of these observables are not collinear safe, but are measured more precisely, and universal nonperturbative functions can absorb the collinear singularities. The unfolded data are directly compared with QCD calculations and hadron-level Monte Carlo simulations. The measurements are performed in different pseudorapidity regions, which are then used to extract quark and gluon jet shapes using the predicted quark and gluon fractions in each region. All of the parton shower and analytical calculations provide an excellent description of the data in most regions of phase space.},

  abstract = {Jet grooming algorithms are widely used in experimental analyses at hadron colliders to remove contaminating radiation from within jets. While the algorithms perform a great service to the experiments, their intricate algorithmic structure and multiple parameters has frustrated precision theoretic understanding. In this paper, we demonstrate that one particular groomer called soft drop actually makes precision jet substructure easier. In particular, we derive a factorization formula for a large class of soft drop jet substructure observables, including jet mass. The essential observation that allows for this factorization is that, without the soft wide-angle radiation groomed by soft drop, all singular contributions are collinear. The simplicity and universality of the collinear limit in QCD allows us to show that to all orders, the normalized differential cross section has no contributions from non-global logarithms. It is also independent of process, up to the relative fraction of quark and gluon jets. In fact, soft drop allows us to define this fraction precisely. The factorization theorem also explains why soft drop observables are less sensitive to hadronization than their ungroomed counterparts. Using the factorization theorem, we resum the soft drop jet mass to next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic accuracy. This requires calculating some clustering effects that are closely related to corresponding effects found in jet veto calculations. We match our resummed calculation to fixed order results for both e+e- \textrightarrow{} dijets and pp \textrightarrow{} Z + j events, producing the first jet substructure predictions (groomed or ungroomed) to this accuracy for the LHC.},

We identify the missing ingredients needed for next-to-next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNNLL) resummation of the modified mass mass drop tagger (mMDT) groomed jet mass in e+e- collisions: the low-scale collinear-soft constants at two-loop accuracy, c(2)Sc, and the three-loop noncusp anomalous dimension of the global soft function, {$\gamma$}(2)S. We present a method for extracting those constants using fixed-order codes: the event2 program to obtain the color coefficients of c(2)Sc, and mccsm for extracting {$\gamma$}(2)S. We present all necessary formulae for resummation of the mMDT groomed heavy jet mass distribution at NNNLL accuracy.},
